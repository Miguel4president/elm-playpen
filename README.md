# Elm - Playpen

This is basic elm from the architecture tutorial. I was just making random things and figured it should be in git since I'd like to refer to it later.

Everything in src should be runable with elm-reactor


## Run The Examples

After you [install Elm](http://guide.elm-lang.org/get_started.html), run the following commands in your terminal to download this repo and start a server that compiles Elm for you:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial.git
cd elm-architecture-tutorial
elm-reactor
```

Now go to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) and start looking at the `examples/` directory. When you edit an Elm file, just refresh the corresponding page in your browser and it will recompile!
